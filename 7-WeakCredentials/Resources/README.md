# Weak Credentials + Improper Restriction of Login Attempts

## üìñ Vulnerability Explanation
The application does not limit the authentication attempts, making a brute force attack possible. In addition to this, there is no strong password policy, facilitating password attacks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Exploitation Process
We will use ```hydra``` to perform the brute force attack and ```Seclists``` for the wordlists arguments. 

- Run hydra with the correct wordlists path:

```
hydra -L /sgoinfre/students/apena-ba/cybersecurity/SecLists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt -P /sgoinfre/students/apena-ba/cybersecurity/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/xato-net-10-million-passwords-100.txt 127.0.0.1 -s 9090 http-get-form '/index.php:page=signin&username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:WrongAnswer.gif'
```

In order to use the http-get-form module, we must define a format string containing three parts:
1. Route to the login page
2. Parameters must contain at least one format string ```^USER^``` or ```^PASS^```
3. Failure string present in the response to recognise valid attempts

> It looks like any username works for the password _shadow_

## üß∞ Additional Resources
Hydra is a brute force attack tool used to test password security on several protocols and services. It uses wordlists as parameters and can be used for both password bruteforcing and password spraying.

The wordlists we used for the brute force attack are part of the SecLists project, which is a recognised repository with multiple wordlists for various purposes.

## üîß Fix
To protect the app authentication, two fixes should be implemented:

1. **Strong password policy**: Forcing users to set strong passwords limits the risk of being compromised by a malicious actor
2. **Limit login attempts**: To prevent brute force attacks, the app should restrict the amount of attempts on each account

## ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì Advanced explanation
In order to strenghen the security posture of the application, we could use IDS/IPS to detect and protect against brute force attacks in real time. Furthermore, these systems log suspicious activities reinforcing the security on a network level.
