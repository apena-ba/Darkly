# Credentials Exposure via htpasswd

## üìñ Vulnerability Explanation
Credential exposure is a misconfiguration vulnerability that happens when private authentication information is exposed to non authorized users.

In this exercise, we can find a username and hash combination publicly available. We can then use these to authenticate on the admin page.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Exploitation Process

- Enumerate the web directories via web fuzzing:

```
ffuf -u 'http://BornToSec.com/FUZZ' -w /sgoinfre/students/apena-ba/cybersecurity/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -fs 975

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\      
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

```

We find a htpasswd file in the ```whatever/``` directory. After downloading the file, we can see a username and hash combination.
```

root:437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49
```

---

- Check the hash value:

Use the credentials obtained to login on the ```admin/``` directory and get the flag.

## üß∞ Additional Resources Used
In order to enumerate web directories we used ```ffuf```, a compiled web fuzzer written in go.

- https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf

The wordlist we used is part of the SecLists project, which is a recognised repository with multiple wordlists for various purposes.

- https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git

We used https://crackstation.net/ to crack the hash. This page doesn't really _crack_ the hash you provide, but performs a lookup on pre-computed hashes instead.

## üîß Fix
The file ```htpasswd``` or any file containing credentials should never be exposed. Configuring nginx to protect this file prevents unauthorized access.

## ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì Advanced explanation
A properly configured nginx config file would look like this:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name BornToSec.com;

    root /var/www/html;

    location /admin/ {
        auth_basic           "Restricted Area";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    }

    location ~ /\.htpasswd {
        deny all;
    }

    location / {
        index index.php;
    }
}
```
