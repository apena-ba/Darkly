# Credentials Exposure via htpasswd

## üìñ Vulnerability Explanation
Credential exposure is a misconfiguration vulnerability that happens when private authentication information is exposed to non authorized users.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Exploitation Process

- Enumerate the web directories via web fuzzing.
```
ffuf -u 'http://localhost:9090/FUZZ' -w /sgoinfre/students/apena-ba/cybersecurity/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -fs 975

We find a htpasswd file present in the ```whatever/``` directory. After downloading the file, we can see a username and hash combination.
```

root:437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49
```

---
- Check the hash value:

Use the credentials obtained to login on the ```admin/``` directory and get the flag.

## üß∞ Additional Resources
In order to enumerate web directories we used ```ffuf```, a compiled web fuzzer written in go.

- https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf

The wordlist we used part of the SecLists project, which is a recognised repository with multiple wordlists for various purposes.

- https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git

We used ```https://crackstation.net/``` to crack the hash. This page doesn't really _crack_ the hash you provide, but performs a lookup on pre-computed hashes instead.

## üîß Fix
The file ```htpasswd``` or any file containing credentials should never be exposed to unauthorized users. Configuring nginx to restrict access to this file is recommended.

## ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì Advanced explanation
A properly configured nginx config file could look like this:
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name bornToSec.com;

    root /var/www/html;

    location /admin/ {
        auth_basic           "Restricted Area";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    }

    location ~ /\.htpasswd {
        deny all;
    }

    location / {
        index index.php;
    }
}
```
