```

---

- Reading the ```robots.txt``` file reveals a directory called ```.hidden/```:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /whatever
Disallow: /.hidden
```

---

The folder contains one ```README``` file and a tree of directories and subdirectories containing more ```README``` files. We coded a python script to crawl all the files in the directory ```.hidden/``` and its subdirectories.

---

- Look for the flag using the command find:

```
find . -type f -exec grep flag {} \; -exec echo -e '\n [+] Flag found in file:' {} '\n' \;
```
