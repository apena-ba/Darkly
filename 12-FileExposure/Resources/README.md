# File and Directory Exposure via accessible ```.hidden/``` directory

## üìñ Vulnerability Explanation
File and directory exposure is a misconfiguration vulnerability that allows an unauthorized user access to sensitive resources.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Exploitation Process

- Enumerate the web directories via web fuzzing:

```
ffuf -u 'http://BornToSec.com/FUZZ' -w /sgoinfre/students/apena-ba/cybersecurity/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -fs 975

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

```

---

- Reading the ```robots.txt``` file reveals a directory called ```.hidden/```:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /whatever
Disallow: /.hidden
```

---

The folder contains one ```README``` file and a tree of directories and subdirectories containing more ```README``` files. We coded a python script to crawl all the files in the directory ```.hidden/``` and its subdirectories.

---

We coded a script to download all the files recursively present in a web server configured for directory listing.

In order to run it, we must create a python virtual environment and install the required packages using the ```requirements.txt``` file.

```
python3 -m venv my-python-env
```
```
./my-python-env/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```
./my-python-env/bin/python3 crawl.py 'http://BornToSec.com/.hidden/' ./dump
```

---

- Look for the flag using the command find:

```
find ./dump -type f -exec grep flag {} \; -exec echo -e '\n[+] Flag found in file:' {} '\n' \;
```

## üîß Fix
To prevent unwanted exposure of resources, we must implement a solid server configuration. Additionally, performing testing and security assessments regularly is recommended to ensure there are no misconfurations.

## ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì Advanced explanation
The script we coded is a web crawler that downloads all files from a given base URL where directory listing is enabled. It recursively goes over routes and saves them, to then download all the files, showing the progress status. 

Usage:

```
python3 crawl.py <url> <directory>
```

- **url** ‚Üí Base URL to crawl

- **directory** ‚Üí Local folder to save files (created if missing)

Example:

```
python3 crawl.py "http://BornToSec.com/.hidden/" ./dump
```
